# Power_BI-Projects
This repository contains three Power BI projects that I have created for various purposes. These projects are as follows:

#1. Sales Report Dashboards
The Sales Report Dashboards project includes three pages: Sales Overview, Customer Details, and Product Details. These dashboards provide a comprehensive view of sales data, allowing users to easily analyze trends and identify opportunities for growth. The Sales Overview page provides a high-level summary of sales performance, while the Customer Details and Product Details pages offer more granular insights.

#2. Adventure Work Analytics
The Adventure Work Analytics project includes four pages: Production Overview, Production Category Analysis, Inventory Overview, and Production Trend. These dashboards provide insights into the production and inventory data for Adventure Works, a fictitious company. The Production Overview page provides a high-level summary of production performance, while the other pages offer more detailed insights into production categories and trends.

#3. Space Mission Dashboard
The Space Mission Dashboard project includes three pages: Overview, Mission Details, and Rocket Details. These dashboards provide insights into space missions, including details on missions and rockets. The Overview page provides a high-level summary of the data, while the Mission Details and Rocket Details pages offer more granular insights.

All of these Power BI projects were created using Power BI Desktop and are based on publicly available data sources. They are intended to showcase my skills and expertise in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.

#Installation
To use these dashboards, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. Once you have installed Power BI Desktop, simply download the .pbix files for the dashboards you are interested in and open them in Power BI Desktop.

#Acknowledgements
The data used in these dashboards was obtained from publicly available sources. Links to the data sources can be found within the dashboards themselves.
